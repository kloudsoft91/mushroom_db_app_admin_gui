    "description": "The Shaggy Mane is a distinctive mushroom with a white, cylindrical cap that is covered in shaggy scales. When young, the cap is elongated and bullet-shaped, but as it matures, it opens up, and the edges become wavy. The gills are initially white, then turn black and eventually dissolve into an inky liquid, a process known as deliquescence. The stipe is white and hollow.",
    "lookalikes": "The Shaggy Mane has a unique appearance, but young specimens can be confused with the Common Ink Cap (Coprinopsis atramentaria) before the gills turn black.",
